# Container Rebuild Complete! âœ…

Your Docker container has been successfully rebuilt with all the necessary pipeline files!

## What Was Fixed

- âœ… Pipeline directory (`/app/pipeline/`) now included
- âœ… All processing modules present (TopicTagger, EmotionTagger, etc.)
- âœ… Flask app configured correctly
- âœ… Image built successfully: `kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest`

## Next Steps

### 1. Push to Docker Hub

```powershell
# Make sure you're logged into Docker Hub
docker login

# Push the new image
docker push kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest
```

### 2. Update RunPod Endpoint

1. Go to [RunPod Console](https://console.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints)
2. Find your endpoint: **synthisoul-runner-cpu** (or whatever it's named)
3. Click on it to open settings
4. Look for **Container Image** or **Image** setting
5. Update it to: `kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest`
6. Click **Save** or **Update**
7. RunPod will redeploy with the new image

### 3. Test It

After updating:
1. Cancel any stuck jobs in the RunPod dashboard
2. Go to your website: https://sanctuaryarc.com/port-your-bond
3. Upload a test file
4. Check if processing completes successfully

## Expected Processing Times

With the working container, your files should process in:
- **Small files** (< 1MB): ~30 seconds
- **Medium files** (1-10MB): ~2-5 minutes  
- **Large files** (> 10MB): ~5-15 minutes

The 2 stuck jobs in the queue were failing because the old container didn't have the pipeline code. Once you update the endpoint and submit new jobs, they should complete successfully! ðŸš€
