# RunPod Job Never Started Processing

## The Issue

Your job is stuck in the **queue** and never started processing:
- **Delay Time**: 6m 59s (and counting)
- **Execution Time**: "-" (empty = never executed)
- **Worker**: "-" (empty = no worker assigned)

## Why This Is Happening

RunPod **queues** jobs when:
1. All workers are busy
2. Workers are starting up
3. Workers crashed and need to restart

In your case, you only have **1 worker running**, and that worker is likely:
- Either processing a previous job
- Or crashed/failed to start
- Or stuck in a crash loop

## The Fix

### Step 1: Cancel the Stuck Job

Click the **"Cancel"** button on the job in the queue.

### Step 2: Check Worker Status

In RunPod console:
1. Click on the **"Workers"** tab
2. Look at the worker status
3. Do you see:
   - ✅ A healthy worker?
   - ❌ A crashed/starting worker?
   - ⚠️ No workers at all?

### Step 3: Force Restart Workers

Option A: In endpoint settings:
1. Set **Max Workers** to 0
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Set it back to 2
4. Wait for workers to start

Option B: Check the "Logs" tab:
1. Click on "Workers" tab
2. Look for any error messages
3. Copy and paste them here

### Step 4: Submit a Fresh Job

After workers are healthy:
1. Upload a new test file
2. Submit the job
3. It should start processing immediately (not wait in queue)

## Diagnosis

The job is queued for 7+ minutes, which means:
- ❌ The worker is **not** processing it
- ❌ The worker is likely **crashed** or **dead**
- ❌ RunPod can't assign it to a worker

**This is NOT a processing speed issue** - it's a **worker availability issue**.

## What to Do

1. **Cancel** the job (it's dead)
2. **Check Workers** tab to see worker status
3. **Force restart** workers if needed
4. **Submit a new job** after workers are healthy

Let me know what you see in the Workers tab!
