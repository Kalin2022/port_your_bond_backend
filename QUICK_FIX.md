# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Container Missing Pipeline Files

## The Proof

From your terminal output, the container is missing everything:

```
root@c80906a79f64:/app# ls -la /app
total 68
drwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Sep 10 00:17 .
drwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4096 Oct 27 20:56 ..
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   115 Sep 10 07:05 Dockerfile
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 33510 Sep 10 00:18 package-lock.json
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   221 Sep 10 07:05 package.json
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   830 Sep 10 07:05 server.js
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Sep 10 00:10 utils
```

**NO `pipeline/` directory!** That's why everything is stuck.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Open Terminal in Project Root

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Matth\port_your_bond
```

### 2. Rebuild the Container (THIS TIME FROM THE ROOT!)

```powershell
docker build -t kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest -f runpod/Dockerfile .
```

**KEY**: The `.` at the end tells Docker to use the current directory (`port_your_bond`) as the build context, which includes the `pipeline/` directory.

### 3. Test Locally First

```powershell
docker run -it kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest bash
```

Inside the container:
```bash
ls -la /app/pipeline/
```

You should see:
- TopicTagger.js
- EmotionTagger.js
- FileParser.js
- etc.

### 4. Push to Docker Hub

```powershell
docker login
docker push kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest
```

### 5. Update RunPod

1. Go to RunPod Console
2. Find your endpoint
3. Update container image to: `kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest`
4. Save and redeploy

## Why It Failed Before

The old Docker build command was probably:
```bash
cd runpod
docker build -t kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest .
```

This used `runpod/` as the context, which doesn't have access to the parent `pipeline/` directory!

The fix is to build from the **parent directory** with:
```bash
docker build -t kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest -f runpod/Dockerfile .
```

## What Will Happen to Stuck Jobs?

- They'll either fail or timeout
- You'll need to cancel them or wait
- Resubmit after the new container is deployed

## Expected Processing Time After Fix

- Small: 30 seconds
- Medium: 2-5 minutes
- Large: 5-15 minutes

Your files should process much faster once the container has the actual pipeline code!
