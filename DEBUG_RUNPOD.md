# RunPod v3 Debugging

## Status
- ‚úÖ Container running: v3
- ‚úÖ Worker healthy
- ‚ùå No job processing logs
- ‚ùå Only health checks

## Likely Issues

### 1. Job Not Being Submitted Correctly

Your backend is submitting jobs, but they might be:
- Going to the wrong endpoint
- Using wrong API format
- Missing required parameters

**Check**: Look at your backend logs from Render. You should see:
```
üöÄ RunPod job submitted: <job-id>
```

### 2. Worker Isn't Receiving Jobs

RunPod health checks work, but actual jobs aren't arriving at the worker.

**Check RunPod Console**:
1. Go to endpoint ‚Üí "Requests" tab
2. Look at the stuck job
3. What "Status" does it show?
   - "IN_QUEUE" = waiting for worker
   - "IN_PROGRESS" = worker has it but not processing
   - "COMPLETED" = done (unlikely)

### 3. Wrong HTTP Method or Format

RunPod expects:
```json
POST /run
{
  "input": {
    "inputUrl": "http://tmpfiles.org/...",
    "email": "...",
    "webhook": "..."
  }
}
```

Your `app.py` expects:
```json
POST /
{
  "inputUrl": "...",
  "email": "...",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

**Mismatch!** The formats don't match.

## The Problem

RunPod is calling your endpoint at `/run` but your Flask app listens on `/`.

You need to check what endpoint RunPod is actually calling.
