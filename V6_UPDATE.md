# v6 Update - The Real Fix! ðŸŽ¯

## What Changed

Support confirmed: **Plain HTTP/Flask doesn't work with RunPod Serverless.** You need to use the RunPod SDK handler.

## v6 Changes

1. âœ… Added `runpod` Python package
2. âœ… Created proper `handler.py` using `runpod.serverless.start()`
3. âœ… Handler receives jobs in the correct format
4. âœ… Returns bundle data as base64 (RunPod serverless format)
5. âœ… Pipeline still uses the same Node.js processing

## Next Steps

1. **Update RunPod Endpoint**: Change image to `kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:v6`
2. **Save and Deploy**: Wait for workers to pull the new image
3. **Test**: Submit your 1KB file
4. **Watch**: Worker logs should now show:
   - Job received
   - Pipeline starting
   - Processing complete

## Expected Processing Time

With v6, your 1KB file should process in **10-30 seconds** as expected!

This should FINALLY work. The RunPod SDK is the missing piece that we needed all along.
