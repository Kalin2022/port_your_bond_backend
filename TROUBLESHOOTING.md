# RunPod Processing Troubleshooting

Your 1KB file has been running for 3+ minutes, which is 6-18x longer than expected!

## Expected vs. Actual

- **Expected**: 10-30 seconds for a 1KB file
- **Actual**: 3+ minutes (and counting)

This indicates the processing is failing, not just slow.

## Quick Checks

### 1. Is the Container Actually Updated?

Go to RunPod endpoint and check:
- When did it last start? (If it started BEFORE you updated the image, it's still running the old broken container)
- Look at the endpoint "Details" → "Image" - does it show your username/tag?

### 2. Check Job Logs

In RunPod Console:
1. Go to your endpoint
2. Click on the "Requests" tab
3. Find the stuck job
4. Click on it
5. Look for the "Logs" or "Console" tab
6. Check what error messages appear

Common errors you might see:
```
❌ FileNotFoundError: /app/pipeline/TopicTagger.js
❌ ModuleNotFoundError: Cannot find module './pipeline/TopicTagger'
❌ TypeError: Cannot read property 'tagChunk' of undefined
```

### 3. Check Backend Logs (Render)

Your backend at Render should be receiving job status updates:

```bash
# Check Render logs for webhook activity
# Look for messages like:
# - "RunPod webhook received"
# - "Job completed successfully"
# - "Processing error"
```

## Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Old Container Still Running

RunPod **keeps the old container cached**. You need to:
1. **Force a restart** by changing a setting (like max workers)
2. Or **wait 5-10 minutes** for RunPod to auto-refresh

**Solution**: In RunPod endpoint settings:
- Temporarily change "Max Workers" from 2 to 3, save
- Then change it back to 2, save
- This forces a container refresh

### Issue 2: Container Doesn't Have Flask App

The Docker image might be missing the Flask app.

**Check**: In RunPod, go to worker logs and see what process is running:
```bash
# If you see:
❌ "python3: can't open file 'app.py'"
# Then app.py is missing or in the wrong location
```

### Issue 3: Pipeline Code Not Found

Even though we verified locally that the files exist, RunPod might be looking in the wrong place.

**Check**: Look for errors like:
```
❌ Cannot find module './pipeline/TopicTagger'
❌ ENOENT: no such file or directory '/app/pipeline/TopicTagger.js'
```

## Quick Fix: Recreate Endpoint

If nothing works, the fastest solution:
1. **Delete the old endpoint** in RunPod
2. **Create a new endpoint** with the same image: `kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:v2`
3. Wait for it to start
4. Submit a new test job

## What to Do Right Now

1. **Cancel the stuck job** (it's not going to complete)
2. **Check RunPod worker logs** to see the actual error
3. **Force restart** the endpoint (change max workers temporarily)
4. **Submit a new test** with your 1KB file
