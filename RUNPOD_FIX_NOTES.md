# RunPod Container Fix - Critical Issues Found

## The Problem

Your RunPod container is missing essential files that the pipeline needs to run. The current Docker setup at `C:\Users\Matth\port_your_bond\runpod\Dockerfile` was designed for a different architecture and doesn't include the actual pipeline code.

## Current Issues

1. **Missing Pipeline Files**: The container doesn't have `wirePipeline.js` and the pipeline modules
2. **Wrong Directory Structure**: The Dockerfile expects files that aren't there
3. **Incomplete Build**: The container image likely doesn't have the required Node.js modules

## What Happens When Processing Fails

- Jobs get stuck in processing state
- No output is generated
- Webhook never fires because processing never completes
- Workers keep running but processing nothing

## The Fix

You need to rebuild the Docker container with the correct files. Here's what needs to happen:

### 1. Build a New Dockerfile (at the root level)

Create `C:\Users\Matth\port_your_bond\Dockerfile.runpod`:

```dockerfile
# RunPod Container for SynthiSoul Pipeline
FROM node:18-slim

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    zip \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire pipeline code
COPY pipeline/ ./pipeline/
COPY wirePipeline.* ./

# Compile TypeScript if needed
RUN npx tsc wirePipeline.ts --skipLibCheck || true

# Create the Flask app for RunPod
COPY runpod/app.py ./

# Install Python dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3-pip && \
    pip3 install flask requests

# Create output directory
RUN mkdir -p /tmp/output

# Expose port for health checks
EXPOSE 8000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

# Start the Flask app
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

### 2. Build and Push the Container

```bash
cd C:\Users\Matth\port_your_bond

# Build the image
docker build -f Dockerfile.runpod -t kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest .

# Push to Docker Hub (make sure you're logged in)
docker push kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest
```

### 3. Update RunPod Template

1. Go to RunPod Console
2. Find your endpoint `synthisoul-runner-cpu`
3. Update the container image to use the newly built image
4. Save and redeploy

## Alternative: Check What's Actually in the Container

You can inspect the current container to see what's missing:

```bash
# Check what Docker Hub has for your image
docker pull kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest
docker run -it kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:latest bash

# Once inside the container, check what files exist
ls -la /app/
ls -la /app/pipeline/
```

## Quick Check: Is the Container Even Running?

Your screenshot showed 2 running workers, which is good. The issue is likely that:

1. The container starts successfully (hence "running")
2. But when it tries to process files, it fails because files are missing
3. The Flask app might be returning errors, but RunPod doesn't show internal errors by default

## Estimated Processing Times

Based on the README:
- **Small files** (< 1MB): ~30 seconds  
- **Medium files** (1-10MB): ~2-5 minutes  
- **Large files** (> 10MB): ~5-15 minutes  

Your files might be taking longer because the container is failing silently.

## Next Steps

1. **Option A (Recommended)**: Rebuild and redeploy the Docker container with the fix above
2. **Option B**: Check RunPod logs in the console to see what errors the workers are encountering
3. **Option C**: Cancel the stuck jobs and test with the fixed container once deployed
