# v7 - THE WORKING VERSION! ðŸŽ‰

## Success Indicators

From your logs:
- âœ… Jobs started processing: "Started."
- âœ… Worker received the job
- âœ… File downloaded successfully
- âœ… Pipeline began running

The only error was the JSON format, which v7 now handles!

## What Changed in v7

Updated `FileParser.ts` to handle **both** formats:
1. Direct array: `[{role: "...", content: "..."}, ...]`
2. OpenAI export: `{conversations: [{messages: [...]}]}`

## Next Steps

Update RunPod endpoint to `kalin2022/synthisoul-runner:v7` and submit your test file again.

This should now complete successfully in **10-30 seconds** for your 1KB file! ðŸš€
